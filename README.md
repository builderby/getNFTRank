# NFT Data Extractor

This script allows you to extract data for a specific NFT from MoonRank. It fetches the HTML for the NFT's page on MoonRank and then uses the JSDOM library to extract the rank and traits of the NFT. The rank and traits are then logged to the console.

## Prerequisites<br><br>

- Node.js v12.0.0 or higher
- npm v6.0.0 or higher<br><br>

## Setup<br><br>

        git clone https://github.com/builderby/getNFTRank.git

- Change into the repository directory:

        cd nft-data-extractor

- Install the dependencies:

        npm install

## Usage<br><br>

<br><br>You can also specify the mint address of the NFT you want to extract data for by changing the mintAddress variable at the end of the script.<br><br>

## Output<br><br>

The script will log the NFT's rank and traits to the console:

        ðŸŽ‰ NFT data received:
        Rank: [RANK]

        Traits:
        [TRAIT 1]: [VALUE 1] [PERCENTAGE 1]
        [TRAIT 2]: [VALUE 2] [PERCENTAGE 2]
        ...
